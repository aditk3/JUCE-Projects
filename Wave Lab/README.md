# Wave Lab

Created a generator using 3 different method of audio synthesis:
1. LF Oscillators (low fidelity)
2. BL Oscillators (problems when freqs exceed [Nyquist Limit](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nyquist-limit?lang=us#:~:text=The%20Nyquist%20limit%20represents%20the,color%20or%20pulsed%20wave%20ultrasound.)
3. Wavetable Oscillators (cleanest overall sound; generated with wavetables)
